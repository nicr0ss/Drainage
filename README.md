# Drainage
Developed with Scarlett Sprague to analyse and predict where water will move over terrain.
Applies drainage pattern analysis to a 200x200 grid of terrain elevation data from a location in Scotland.
Future updates will include new rain models to simulate mechanical rainfall and other cloud patterns instead of the current blanket even rainfall.
